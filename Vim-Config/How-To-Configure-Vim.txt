The following is a brief summary of the procedure one can
follow in setting up vim/gvim to navigate a large code base
such as Linux Kernel

Step 1: Install vim-plug

	#
	#  Create the directory given if needed
	#  Will download the file plug.vim to the given directory
	#
	curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
		https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

Step 2: Create following directories

	#
	# Where plugins get installed
	#
	mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugged

	#
	# Folder to define config files to identify
	# filetypes that vim may not pickup
	#
	#	make.vim to detect (M/m)akefile(s)
	#
	mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftdetec

Step 3: Create following preferences

	#
	# Your preferred LEADER KEY to use in mapping
	# various commands in insert, visual and normal
	# modes, either recursively or non-recursively
	#
	touch  ~/.vim/myleader.vim

	#
	# Your standard preferences to bind
	#
	# This config file should not define
	# or enable things that depend on any
	# plugins
	#
	touch  ~/.vim/myprefs.vim

	#
	# Your preferred key bindings
	#
	# This config file should not define
	# or enable things that depend on any
	# plugins
	#
	touch  ~/.vim/mykeys.vim

Step 4: Create the config file that laoas various plugins

	#
	# List of plugins to load using a pluing manager
	# such as vim-plug
	#
	touch  ~/.vim/plugins.vim

Step 5: Create the config files that depend upon plugins

	#
	# Your non-standard key mappings i.e. they depend
	# upon one or more plugins
	#
	touch  ~/.vim/plug-keys.vim

	#
	# Your preferred colorscheme to bind. The choice
	# of colorscheme to bind come from a plugin and
	# are not built-in
	#
	touch  ~/.vim/plug-colors.vim

Step 5: Create the master config file

	#
	# Master config file
	#
	# Config file must specify things in following order
	#
	#		set nocompatible
	#			This ensure access to all vim features
	#
	#		Load config file that defines leader key
	#				e.g. myleader.vim
	#
	#		Load various config files that do not depend
	#			upon a plugin i.e. they are built-ins 
	#			e.g. mykeys.vim
	#			e.g. myprefs.vim
	#				 etc
	#				 (e.g. make.vim)
	#
	#		Code to load the various plugins
	#			e.g. plugins.vim
	#
	#		Load various config files that depend on plugins
	#			e.g. plug-keys.vim
	#			e.g. plug-colors.vim
	#
